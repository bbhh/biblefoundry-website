Like many other God-given gifts, technology can be used either for God's glory or for God's displeasure. My focus is to leverage technology for the edification of the body of Christ (Eph 4:11-16), and aim to develop apps that help (1) *Christians* to grow in their love for Christ and His Word (Phil 1:9-11), (2) *pastors and ministers* to rightly handle the word of truth (2 Tim 2:15), and (3) *churches* to shine as a pillar and buttress of the truth (1 Tim 3:15)."

			bio = "Bryant was born and raised in Rowland Heights, CA. God, in His amazing grace, chose to save this sinner during college. Bryant went on to complete his B.A. at UCLA and M.S. at USC in Computational Linguistics. As he served in the local body of Christ, he discovered the incomparable joy of teaching God’s Word and seeing it bear fruit in people’s lives (Col 1:28). This led Bryant to study at [The Master’s Seminary](http://www.tms.edu/) and obtain an M.Div. in order to be better equipped to teach God’s Word and shepherd God’s people. He is a member of [Immanuel Bible Church](https://www.ibcbible.org/) and works as a software engineer at [SDL](http://www.sdl.com). In his spare time, he enjoys eating good eats, playing basketball, reading Christian books, developing apps, roasting/brewing coffee, making sourdough bread, learning languages, biking, traveling, and especially spending time with his family. Bryant lives in Valencia, CA, with his wife Juliette and their three sons."
